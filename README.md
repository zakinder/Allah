## Allah Created Heavens and Earth Six Days

Surah Al-A'raf (7:54):

"Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne. He covers the night with the day, [another night] chasing it rapidly; and [He created] the sun, the moon, and the stars, subjected by His command. Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah, Lord of the worlds."

Formation of the Heavens and the Earth from BigBang Universe Smoke



This verse suggests that the heavens and the earth were initially in a gaseous or nebulous state, which aligns somewhat with modern scientific ideas about the early state of the universe.

Surah Fussilat (41:11):

"Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, 'Come [into being], willingly or by compulsion.' They said, 'We have come willingly.'"
